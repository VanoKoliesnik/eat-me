# Eat Me

supported by [@StasVorobiov](https://github.com/StasVorobiov). ❤

My thesis project. Nothing interesting, but if you want to run it, just believe in a miracle and do the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/VanoKolesnik/eat-me.git
```

```
npm i
```

For production:

```
npm run build
```

For development:

```
npm run start
```
